# ☀️ AI-Powered Rooftop Solar Analysis Tool

This project was built for the **Solar Industry AI Assistant Internship**. It uses computer vision to simulate solar potential analysis of rooftops from satellite or drone images.

### 🔍 Features

- Upload rooftop images (JPG/PNG)
- Image preprocessing (grayscale + edge detection)
- Simulated solar potential score
- Installation recommendation (panel fit, shadow caution)
- Estimated ROI (payback period, lifetime savings)
- Built using **Streamlit**, no API keys required

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repo  
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`  
3. Run: `streamlit run app.py`

### 📷 Example Use Case

> Upload a top-down rooftop image.  
> Get edge detection, area estimation, and a report with ROI and solar panel advice.
